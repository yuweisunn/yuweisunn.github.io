    <h1>Future of Collaborative and Decentralized Machine Learning: Opportunities and Challenges</h1>
    <h3>Date: May 19th
    <h3>Place: UTokyo (Hongo campus), Engineering Building 2, 4F Room 242</h3>
    <p>Collaborative and decentralized machine learning (ML) is a rapidly evolving field that presents new opportunities and challenges. In this workshop session, we will explore the opportunities and challenges of collaborative and decentralized ML, with a focus on its future. Our aim is to bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to discuss the latest developments in this field, exchange ideas, and identify key research questions and directions.</p>
